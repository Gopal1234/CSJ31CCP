
What is stored procedure:
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.



benifit of Store  procedure:

Reusable: As mentioned, multiple users and applications can easily use and reuse stored procedures


Easy to modify: You can quickly change the statements in a stored procedure as and when you want to, with the help of the ALTER TABLE command.

Security: Stored procedures allow you to enhance the security of an application or a database by restricting the users from direct access to the table.

Low network traffic: The server only passes the procedure name instead of the whole query, reducing network traffic.






In JDBC how many types of statement ?
There are three types of statement
1.Statement<Interface>
   |
PreparedStatement<Child Interface>
   |
CallableStatement< child interface is the child of prepared statement>


Callable statement is used to call stored procudure

who is providing the implementation of statement?

***
Driver software vendor is responsable to implement all the above statements


How to create object of callable statement

1. CallableStatement cs=conObj.prepareCall(String procedure call);

Example:
CallableStatement cs=conObj.prepareCall("{call addProc(?,?,?) }");

where call is the JDBC keyword
addProc is the procudure name
(?,?,?)--> is the parameters

****
Once we call the store procedure using jdbc, first it make a call to database server engine to check whether that stored procedure is available or not 
if yes then it return the object of Callable statement otherwise it throws SqlException



Steps to call stored procedure:

1. make sure that Stored procedure should be alraedy there is database

2.create callable statement object

3.set values for every IN parameter by using setter methods

4.register every OUT parameter with JDBCC type

5.execute stored procedure

6.get the result using corresponding getter  methods
