java uses I/O stream to make operation fast.
java.io package contains all classes to process input and output operations

what is stream?
stream is a sequence of data.
stream data is nothing but collections of bytes


In Java, 3 streams are created for us automatically. All these streams are attached with the console.

1) System.out: standard output stream

2) System.in: standard input stream

3) System.err: standard error stream

OutputStream
Java application uses an output stream to write data to a destination; it may be a file, an array, peripheral device or socket.


  OutputStream class is an abstract class.
 It is the superclass of all classes representing an output stream of bytes.
methods of OutputStream class

1.public void write(int)throws IOException	
    --->is used to write a byte to the current output stream.
2. public void write(byte[])throws IOException	
  ---->is used to write an array of byte to the current output stream.
3. public void close()throws IOException	
---->is used to close the current output stream.


OutputStream class is implemented by several child classes like,
i.FileOutputStream
ii.ByteArrayOutputStream
iii.FilterOutputStream
iv.PipedOutputStream
v.ObjectOutputStream



i.FileOutputStream:

 A. FileOutputStream is one of the child class of OutputStream
 B. FileOutputStream is used to write byte oriented as well as character oriented file

to create a file we use two constrcutors of FileOutputStream

i.FileOutputStream(File file, boolean append)
ii.FileOutputStream(String filePath, boolean append) 

to write any content to a file we use the follwoing methods of FileOutputStream

i.void write(byte[] ary)	
 --->It is used to write ary.length bytes from the byte array to the file output stream.
ii. void write(byte[] ary, int off, int len)	
---->It is used to write len bytes from the byte array starting at offset off to the file output stream.
iii. void write(int b)	
----->It is used to write the specified byte to the file output stream.








InputStream
Java application uses an input stream to read data from a source; it may be a file, an array, peripheral device or socket.


InputStream class is an abstract class

InputStream class proviodes the following methods to read character as well as byte oriented data from differnet I/O channel.

Methods are:
1. public abstract int read()throws IOException

---->reads the next byte of data from the input stream. It returns -1 at the end of the file.

2.public int available()throws IOException
----->returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read from the current input stream.

3.public void close()throws IOException
----->is used to close the current input stream.

Since it is a abstract class, it is implemented by several child classes

i.FileInputStream
ii.ByteArrayInputStream
iii.FilterInputStream
iv.PipedInputStream
v.ObjectOutputStream


i.FileInputStream:

 A. FileInputStream is one of the child class of OutputStream
 B. FileInputStream is used to read byte oriented as well as character oriented file

to read file from different resource, we use two constrcutors of FileInputStream

i.FileInputStream(File file)
ii.FileInputStream(String filePath 

to read any content to a file we use the follwoing methods of FileInputStream

i)int read()	
-->It is used to read the byte of data from the input stream.
ii)int read(byte[] b)	
-->It is used to read up to b.length bytes of data from the input stream.
iii)int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)	
-->It is used to read up to len bytes of data from the input stream.
